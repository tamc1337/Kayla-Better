            <h3 class="">Kayla was born to a loving family in the middle of nowhere, East Pennsyltuckyginia. However, one cold night, a bear snuck into her house and kidnapped the infant! Preparing to snack on the wriggling morsel, something about the child struck into the bears heart. Instead of feasting on her, she was raised in the woods to become a child of nature. After a difficult few months, she was forever changed as she returned to her human parents. <br><br>
            The rest of her childhood included dominating other, weaker children to submit to her demands, she eventually moved away to college and graduated with a grade so high, the letter is no longer allowed to be uttered. She works full time at some place but makes art on the side.
